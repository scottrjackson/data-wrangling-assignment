# Data Wrangling Assignment

For this assignment, read through the PDF file, type in code as you go (literally type, don't copy-paste), and try the exercises.  If you run into problems, you can check the code in the `.Rmd` file that is the source for the PDF, and you can check the solutions to the Practice Exercises in the "solutions" file.

Good luck, enjoy, and if you have feedback/gripes/problems/victories, please submit those as issues as soon as you can, so I can prepare for our next session.
